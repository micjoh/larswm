This project is a place to store bits I held about larswm
window-manager, as they are not easily findable online.

In the Download section are patches from Mikolaj Golub, containing
patches from Florian Forster.

The patches are applied to the repository.

I added some patches I made and used daily :

+ Shortcuts to switch windows when in switch focus mode
+ Room for a panel at top of the screen
+ Allow windows to be moved outside the screen, to handle big dialogs on small screens

There are a few pages about larswm still online :

 * Florian Forster's Homepage contains a [larswn guide](http://verplant.org/larswm/) and a [patch for xinerama](http://verplant.org/larswm-xinerama.shtml)
 * An old page in french : [http://hocwp.free.fr/larswm.html](http://hocwp.free.fr/larswm.html)
 * A mirror of the old site : [http://porneia.free.fr/larswm/larswm.htm](http://porneia.free.fr/larswm/larswm.html)
